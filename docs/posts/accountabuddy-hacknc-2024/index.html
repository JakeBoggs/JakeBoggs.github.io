What started as a simple “Wouldn’t it be cool if an AI actually rang you to ask if you’d done your work?” turned into AccountaBuddy, a lightweight app that does more than fire off push notifications - it actually calls you, celebrates your wins, and helps you problem-solve when tasks stall.\nThe Why: When Reminders Aren’t Enough I’m not the only one who’s ever ignored yet another notification. A to-do list can feel like a list of obligations, or worse, just noise. AccountaBuddy was born from the idea that human accountability is powerful - so why not let technology step in as a friendly collaborator? Instead of sending one-way reminders, it reaches out, listens to you, and adapts to your situation.\nWhat It Does, in Practice Task creation \u0026 scheduling: Sign up, add your tasks, and pick check-in times. Real-time voice calls: At each scheduled moment, AccountaBuddy actually rings your phone via bland.ai. Dynamic follow-up: If you’ve completed a task, it cheers you on. If not, it asks what’s blocking you and suggests next steps. Interactive planning: You can reprioritize or break a big goal into bite-sized actions in an on-the-fly chat. Rather than a static list of “done” or “not done,” it turns to-dos into a conversation. The UI was inspired by our code editor, Cursor, with the AI proposing modifications to the to-do list and the user confirming or denying them.\nUnder the Hood Despite having just two developers and 24 hours, we got a working proof of concept by combining:\nNext.js + React for the UI and routing Prisma for defining and managing users and tasks in our database bland.ai for dialing out and handling call flows ChatGPT to guide the conversation, interpret responses, and offer personalized suggestions What We Struggled With State management: React’s component lifecycle can be tricky when you need live updates for tasks that might change status mid-call. API choreography: We had to make sure calls, chat logic, and database updates stayed in sync without visible delays. Background jobs: Scheduling outbound calls reliably—especially under a tight timeline—meant building a small worker queue and retry logic. Takeaways \u0026 Next Steps By the end of the hackathon, AccountaBuddy was already helping us plan the remaining tasks, but there’s still more we’d like to do in the future:\nStripe integration for a lightweight subscription model Live voice conversations powered by ChatGPT Advanced Voice Mode, so you can brainstorm out loud with your AI buddy in real time Deeper analytics, to show you trends in your productivity rather than just individual tasks ","wordCount":"455","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-11-04T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2024-11-04T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jake Boggs"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://boggs.tech/posts/accountabuddy-hacknc-2024/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Jake Boggs","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://boggs.tech/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://boggs.tech/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)">Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://boggs.tech/about title="About me"><span>About me</span></a></li><li><a href=https://boggs.tech/startups title=Startups><span>Startups</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">AccountaBuddy: Your AI Accountability Partner - HackNC 2024</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-11-04 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 4, 2024</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;3 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;455 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Jake Boggs</div></header><div class=post-content><p>Check out the project on <strong><a href=https://devpost.com/software/nudge-4groy0>Devpost</a></strong> and view the source code on <strong><a href=https://github.com/JakeBoggs/AccountaBuddy-HackNC2024>GitHub</a></strong>.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen loading=eager referrerpolicy=strict-origin-when-cross-origin src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YLjw9UnhMEI?autoplay=0&controls=1&end=0&loop=0&mute=0&start=0" style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 title="YouTube video"></iframe></div><p>I spent a weekend at HackNC building something to help manage all of my other side projects.

title: "Startups"
---
This page has been up for a while but I recently realized I had never written an explanation of why it exists: I've always had an irrational fear of getting stuck. Not just in a claustrophobic sense, but also in life. That's partially why I've been drawn to startups. Every day is something new and you must constantly learn and grow, or die. There are many other more "college-essay / job-application appropriate" aspects I enjoy too (solving problems, building things, ownership etc are great), but this fear more than anything has been the biggest driver. That, coupled with a strong belief that following conventional wisdom will give you conventional outcomes, motivated me to drop out of college with a semester left when I received an offer from a company I truly believe in. Now that has been said, here are the startups I'm most proud to be / have been a part of:

## Investments

> **Update:** After dropping out and getting a clearer picture of the areas I want to work in, the motivations below no longer fully reflect my current thinking. Although I still want to invest in people and ideas that I believe in, I have come to view that the best way for me to leverage myself is by directly focusing on solving the problems I care about. This is also what excites me the most and now where I am dedicating the bulk of my effort.

Eventually I want to run my own VC fund, so I've been practicing through [Reg-CF](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/regulation-crowdfunding). Hopefully one day this will serve as a track record when I raise money, but in the meantime it's teaching me a lot and reading the quarterly updates is always exciting. I initially set out to make 100 investments by the time I graduated college, so far I'm 3 years in with 51 investments across 49 companies. Been slowing down lately to focus on other projects, so 100 seems unlikely, but I'm satisfied with my progress and I've learned a lot.

### Exits

### Highlights

These have been the best performers, with substantial revenue growth and/or follow-on rounds at higher valuations.
